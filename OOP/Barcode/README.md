Run the frontend.py to start the program and press ESC key to exit the program.

This program is made for my company to keep records of patients and their points, 
which are queried with a barcode on their loyalty cards. 
The database is Sqlite as it is local app and there are no multiple requests at the same time. Otherwise, I would use MySQL or 
PostgreSQL.

You can try to add new patient and to carry the same by manually entering the barcode. Try to edit, delete or to add points to
the existing patient.
